# Knowledge-Management-Assistant
Knowledge management assistant project, developed by a team of students as their SE 4485 class project.

This project aims to create a system in which users, known as Knowledge Managers, submit queries for analysis. This app will search the internet for results concerning the query and generate a response based on data aggregated from the internet as well as past results. A user will also be able to go through the history and save and delete queries based on business/personal need.
