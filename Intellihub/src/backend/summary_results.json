    "query": "How do you become an english teacher in Japan?",
    "response": "Becoming an English teacher in Japan typically requires a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, though some exceptions exist for those on specific visas (working holiday, student, spouse). While a degree in English education or a related field is advantageous, it's not always mandatory; a degree in any field is often sufficient. Native-level English proficiency is crucial, and a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate can significantly improve job prospects, even with a degree. The process generally involves securing a visa appropriate for work in Japan. This often depends on your nationality and existing visa status. Once a suitable visa is obtained, you can begin searching for teaching positions. Many opportunities exist in various settings: public schools, private language schools (eikaiwa), universities, and international schools. Job postings often appear on online job boards and through recruitment agencies specializing in overseas teaching positions. Several factors influence your success. Your teaching experience (even volunteer experience) will enhance your application. Competitive candidates possess excellent communication and classroom management skills. Age can also be a factor, with some institutions favoring younger applicants, while others have age limits (generally under 60). While some institutions may prioritize candidates with specific teaching qualifications, many value native English fluency and a demonstrated passion for teaching. Finally, researching different types of schools and their specific requirements is essential to tailoring your application and maximizing your chances of securing a position."
